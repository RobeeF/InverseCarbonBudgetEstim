Code to replicate the results of Baumas, Fuchs et al. (2023): "Reconstructing the oceanâ€™s mesopelagic zone carbon budget: sensitivity and estimation of parameters associated with prokaryotic remineralization".

This repository is not a stand-alone package. It just hosts the code necessary to replicate the results.

Download this repository using GitHub Desktop or by downloading the zip directly.
To do so, click on the green "Code" menu in the top right and choose the desired option.  
The downloaded (and unzipped if needed) directory will be referred to as "root.folder" in the sequel.
The root.folder contains four subdirectories: the "Codes" repository fetch the data in the "Data" repository and reproduce the results in the "Results" directory. The "Raw_data" is simply given for researchers interested in the data before integration and post-treatment.

To run the code on your machine, please just modify the root.path, in the dedicated scripts:
```python
root.folder = "your_path_to_data" # Modify with the path on your machine
```
